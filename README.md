# JSON-EDI Orders Specification

**[Leia em portuguÃªs](pt-BR/README.md)**

The goal of this project is to provide a simple, universal standard for information sharing between companies. It's important for this standard to be neutral and accessible for companies to exchange information.

You can think of this standard proposal as an easier to implement alternative to [EDIFACT](https://www.unece.org/cefact/edifact/welcome.html). We use JSON as a document format for our messages. We believe it provides a readable, easily parseable and lightweight data structure. Besides, it's been really popular among developers, with lots of parsing libraries for numerous languages, so it's a natural choice.

## Roadmap

This project is a work in progress to achieve [Version 1](https://github.com/json-edi/spec/milestone/1).

We wish for this new standard to be compatible with all of the message types of EDIFACT.

We are currently working on the [orders](orders.md) spec.

## Contributing

We encourage everyone involved with the B2B commerce market to contribute to this project. The goal is to stop worrying about numerous message exchanging standards and focus on one that works for everyone.

## Sponsors

Coming soon.

## License

The project is completely free and open to use, we provide it under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
