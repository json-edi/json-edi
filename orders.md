# JSON-EDI Orders Specification

This document contains the spec for the orders between companies within the JSON-EDI project.

We recommend you to read the [protocol](protocol.md) document as well, to understand how to send and receive messages.

The goal with this specification document is to provide an easy and simple way to exchange orders among parties.

You can say this spec is comparable to the [ORDERS](https://service.unece.org/trade/untdid/d02a/trmd/orders_c.htm) section of [EDIFACT](https://www.unece.org/cefact/edifact/welcome.html), but simpler and easier to understand and implement.

## Examples

Soon, for now [check this out](message_samples/orders.json).
